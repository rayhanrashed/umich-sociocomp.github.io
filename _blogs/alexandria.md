teaser: What if you could choose which values shape your social media feed? Alexandria offers a library of 78 valuesâ€”from well-being to civic engagementâ€”that users can mix and match to re-rank their X/Twitter feeds in real time, moving beyond engagement-driven algorithms toward user-controlled, values-based curation.

## The Problem: Engagement Isn't Everything

<img src="/imgs/teasers/alexandria.png" alt="Alexandria Interface" style="width: 100%; height: auto;">

Today's social media algorithms optimize for one thing above all: **engagement**. They show you content that will make you like, share, and commentâ€”regardless of whether that content supports your well-being, promotes healthy discourse, or aligns with values you actually care about.

The result? Many users report feeling that their feeds are:
- Over-optimized for time spent rather than time well spent
- Filled with content that seems arbitrary or misaligned with their preferences
- Frustrating, with limited effective controls to shape what they see

As one participant in our study put it: *"I try to just stay within the people I'm following, but I do often find myself navigating over to a For You page or the Explore page, which can often be a time drain."*

## A Different Approach: Value-Based Ranking

What if instead of letting engagement metrics alone determine your feed, you could explicitly choose which **values** matter to you? Should your feed prioritize:

- **Wisdom** and **Knowledge** over viral content?
- **Cheerful** and **Humorous** posts over rage-inducing ones?
- **Civic Engagement** and **Productive Discourse** over partisan animosity?
- **Well-being** and **Mental Health** over endless doom-scrolling?

This is the vision behind **Alexandria**â€”named after the historical Great Library of Alexandria, which curated knowledge across the ancient world. Our system similarly aims to enable a pluralistic approach to value-embedded feed curation.

## Building a Library of Values

Rather than choosing a single "correct" set of values, we built a **library** that combines multiple value systems from across the literature:

**Classical Psychology:**
- Rokeach's Value Survey (36 values)
- Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs (8 values)
- Hofstede's Cultural Dimensions (14 values)

**Social Media & Recommender Systems:**
- Stray et al.'s values for recommender systems (31 values)
- Reddit community values (29 values)
- Weibo co-creation values (28 values)

After filtering for post-level applicability and merging strongly correlated values, we arrived at **78 distinct values** that users can configure.

## How Alexandria Works

Alexandria is a Chrome browser extension for X/Twitter that operates in three steps:

### 1. Value Discovery and Selection

When you first install Alexandria, you're shown five diverse starting values:
- "A World at Peace"
- "Education and Entertainment"
- "Knowledge, Informativeness"
- "Appreciation"
- "Collectivism"

For each, you can **uprank** (want to see more), **downrank** (want to see less), or ignore it. The system then recommends similar values based on your selections, letting you iteratively refine your preferences.

### 2. Real-Time Feed Re-Ranking

As you browse X/Twitter, Alexandria:
1. Silently collects ~70 posts from your "For You" feed
2. Sends each post to GPT-4o-mini to label the strength of each value (0 = not present, 1 = weakly present, 2 = strongly present)
3. Computes a score for each post using the dot product of value labels and your configured weights
4. Re-orders your feed based on these scores

The entire process takes 5-10 seconds, adding minimal latency to your browsing experience.

### 3. Iterative Refinement

You can continuously adjust your values:
- Change weights using sliders (0.1 to 1.0)
- Add new values from the full library
- Remove values that aren't working
- See immediate results with each re-ranking

## What We Learned from Users

We conducted two studies to understand how people use Alexandria:

### Qualitative Study (N=12)

**Users appreciate control:**
> *"I felt like I definitely did have control. [I] definitely saw results from updating and re-ranking my feed based on changing the valuesâ€¦ I did notice a big difference."* â€”P12

**The full library offers flexibility:**
10 of 12 participants preferred the full library over a single value system, noting:
> *"I like the one that has a lot of different options, because that helps me really kind of tweak what I'd be most interested in seeing."* â€”P9

**Values promote awareness:**
Using the tool made participants more conscious of what they wanted to see:
> *"There's one [value] here. It says obedient, and I'm thinking of those trad wife videos, and I'm like, that's not for me."* â€”P8

### Quantitative Study (N=257)

We compared users who had access to the **full library** (N=44) versus those limited to a **single value system** (N=213).

**Popular Values:**
The most commonly upranked values included:
- **Knowledge, informativeness** (72.3%)
- **Usefulness** (56.8%)
- **Wisdom** (54.5%)
- **Cheerful** (50.0%)

The most commonly downranked values:
- **Spam, Reposts, Bots** (43.2%)
- **Collectivism** (43.2%)
- **Adherence to norms** (40.9%)

**The library accommodates diversity:**
While some values were popular across users, **61.5% of values were selected by less than half of participants**â€”demonstrating that a large, diverse library is necessary to accommodate different needs.

**Filling gaps:**
When asked what values they wished existed, **65.5% of desired values** from users in single-system conditions were already present in our full library.

## Key Insights

### 1. No Universal "Best" Values

Our findings reinforce that **diverse user needs require diverse values**. While some values (like downranking spam) are nearly universal, many values matter deeply to specific individuals or subsets of users.

### 2. Precision Through Plurality

The full library allows users to be more **precise** about their preferences. For example, users who initially selected "Equality" (weight 0.50) in a single system switched to more specific values like "Broadminded" (0.23), "Care, compassion, empathy" (0.30), or "Tolerance" (0.13) when given access to the full library.

### 3. Control â‰  Filter Bubbles

Participants valued being able to **click through** to see original content and appreciated that the system wasn't perfect. As one noted:
> *"I don't feel that it's psychologically healthy to feel like you have 100% control, because that's not how the real world works."*

## Design Implications

**Toward a Marketplace of Values:**
Alexandria could be enhanced to let users and communities **propose new values**, creating a marketplace where people can subscribe to value configurations that match their needs.

**Balancing Autonomy and Society:**
While user control is valuable, we must thoughtfully design to prevent values-based filter bubbles. Platforms should include mechanisms that encourage exposure to diverse content while respecting user agency.

**Platform Integration:**
While Alexandria works as a browser extension, its approach could be **far more efficient** if integrated directly into platforms, which have access to full content inventories and computational resources.

## Looking Forward

Alexandria demonstrates that the values criticized as missing from social media algorithms **can be operationalized today** through end-user tools. By giving users control over which values shape their feeds, we can move toward social media experiences that align with what people actually care aboutâ€”not just what keeps them scrolling.

The future questions are:
- How do we govern an expanding library of values?
- What are the long-term effects of value-based ranking on user behavior and societal discourse?
- How can we extend this approach to mobile platforms and other social networks?
